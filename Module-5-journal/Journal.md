Throughout Modules 4 and 5, I learned more about how Git supports version control and collaboration in software development. One of the most important concepts I gained was how branching helps manage changes without breaking the main codebase. Creating feature branches allows developers to work independently while keeping the main branch stable. This made it clearer why Git is essential for team-based projects. Another key topic was pull requests and merging. I learned how pull requests allow changes to be reviewed before being merged into the main branch. This process improves code quality and reduces errors, especially when multiple people are contributing to the same project.Understanding merge conflicts was challenging at first, but resolving them helped me better understand how Git tracks changes line by line.
